# 📦 Smart Logistic System — Java Practice Project

## 📘 Project Description

The **Smart Logistic System** is a Java practice project that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles together with several important design patterns.
The system simulates a modular logistics platform that manages warehouse devices and notifications.

The goal of this project is to show how design patterns can be used in a realistic software architecture to improve flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.
